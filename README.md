LifeQuest Coding Challenge

This coding challenge will involve a real-world situation and will test a number of things: 

Ability to work with Git Repositories
Ability to quickly get up to speed on an existing source base
Angular Development Capabilities
ASP.NET Web API Capabilities
SQL Server

This exercise is purposefully vague.  Use your best judgements in coding and design decisions.  The actual result isn’t what is important here, but rather we are looking for you to show off some of your skills.  Feel free to show off as much as you want.   

Step 1) Clone the source code repository from GitHub (you should have been emailed an invite to the repository)  https://github.com/robertlair-lifequest/christiancharles-codechallenge

Step 2) Get Angular web application running.  The application resides in the folder “web”

Step 3) Add a new capability to the web application to manage companies.  (Use UI from existing template screens to generate a consistent look)  This should include the following: 

Add entry in left menu titled “Companies”
Add a List Screen
Add an Add/Edit Screen

Step 4) Create an ASP.NET Web API to serve the company screens on the angular project.  Use a SQL Server Express to store the company information.  Be sure to generate a backup of your database (or export a script with schema AND data).  Be sure to add the data backup or scripts to a folder named “data” in the repository. 

Please keep a coding journal describing what you did and why.  Documentation on how to get your example running will be expected (the documentation is part of the coding challenge).  

Good luck!
